# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

This repository offers a setup for an ecommerce back end, where you can use sequelize to manage products in a database.

The established database contains categories, in which different products are categorized. Each product has information pertaining to the product name, price, stock quantity, and any related tags. 

Tags can then be used to further describe products and group products together under a unique trait.
